SLUTCOIN UTILITY PROJECT

The SlutCoin project is a utility token designed to stop chargebacks or friendly fraud and lower the high merchant costs associated with processing
creditcards or debit cards. The platform acts as a third party utility to customers who want to purchase products or services from a merchant. Upon 
accepting the token transfer from the customer, the merchant can validate the settled transaction, provide the products or services to the customer 
without risk of a future chargeback. The utility token project provides minimal cost per transaction versus the traditional high cost processing 
associated with some business SIC/MCC codes, ranging from 10.99% to 20.99% plus up to a $10.00 per transaction fee.

The benefit to the consumer is the lower cost per transaction savings, digital control of the asset and limited visibility from merchant names or service
providers from being listed on the consumers billing statements, creating a new layer of privacy for consumers.
